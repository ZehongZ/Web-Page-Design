Writer’s Introduction
	Hello, all! My name is Zehong Zhuang, an international student from Shenzhen, China. I am Management Information System majored and Computer Science minored. Studying in DePaul University is so enjoyable to me. Like many international students, English is still bothering so much. Even though I have spent two quarters in ELA, a language department of DePaul University, I still have a lot to learn. </p>

    By the way, sports is a big part of my life that interest me all the time. Basketball is the one attracts me most. Luckily, Chicago has a one of the best NBA basketball team, so I am able to go to the United Center enjoying some high level games. Besides basketball, I am also in fond of traveling. The beauty of America definitely has improved the joy. So far, I have travel to some place in Illinois, Indiana, California, Florida, New York and Washington states. Those fresh views, culture and experience are so addicted to me that I have no plan stopping going other places to have a look. Actually, I have decided to go to Las Vegas as my next destination! Waiting for next vacation is really killing me!

I love travel so much and San Francisco is one of the best place I have ever been. Like what I have mentioned in the introduction in the homepage, there are so many wonderful attractions you can pay a visit. For example, you can have a dinner in Fisherman’s Wharf; you can enjoy the beauty of the Golden Gate Bridge; China Town over there has enough resource for you to experience Chinese culture. Besides, San Francisco as a part of California education system, those famous universities are attractive to students from all over the world. Personally, I wish I got chance to continue my further study in Stanford University, but, it is impossible because I am not good enough. No matter how, at least I get a fancy and motivation to push me going up. In addition, San Francisco is a heaven for a sport fan. There are lots of famous sports teams that is playing well in their own league. There is the Golden State Warriors from NBA; San Francisco 49ers is playing in NFL; Giants is shining in MLB. Once you come here, you ca enjoy different kinds of sports you like. As a basketball fan and a fan of Golden State Warriors, I am always planning my second-time trip over there. It is a place that will never be boring. So, I sincerely recommend to everyone.
